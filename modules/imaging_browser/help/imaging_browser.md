# Imaging Browser

The Imaging Browser allows users to browse and view candidate scan
sessions collected at time-points (visits) across the study.

## Searching for a candidate's scans

Use the Selection Filter panel to specify search criteria such as
candidate PSCID, DCCID, Visit Label, Site, Quality Control (QC)
status of the scanning session, and any sequence type (T1, T2, DTI)
in the scan session.

After specifying search criteria in the selection filters, click
"Show Data" to display results in the data table below, with one
row per relevant scanning session. Click "Clear Form" to reset all
selection filters. Sort the data table results by clicking on any column header.

To download, visualize, add QC annotation or view details of imaging
files for a candidate-timepoint, select a dataset type under the "Links"
columns.
