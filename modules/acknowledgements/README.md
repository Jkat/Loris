The purpose of the Acknowledgement Generator is to aid in dynamically generating an appropriate list of people to acknowledge for any given publication.

The code for the public side of things can be found under `htdocs/acknowledgements/`.

Example public facing link: `https://<YOUR-BASE-STUDY-URL>/acknowledgements/acknowledgements.php?date=2017-11-17`

Given the publication date of `2017-11-17`, this will limit the list to people who started on or before `2017-11-17`.
